# lemfi-assignment-ios

This project is the starting point for the LemFi iOS pair programming interview.

## Goal

The app is a *very* basic currency converter. It is intentionally written with several areas for improvement.

## Running the Project

1. Open `LemFiAssignment.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

2. Build and run the project on a simulator or device.

## Interview Tasks

During the pair programming session, we will:

1. Walk through this existing code.

2. Discuss its architecture, "code smells," and areas for improvement.

3. Work together to implement improvements, such as:

   * Making the conversion update automatically (reactively).

   * Adding a "Swap Currencies" button.

   * Improving error handling.

   * Adding a unit test.

   * Fixing at least one architecture issue within the app.

Don't worry about fixing everything before the interview; the "suboptimal" state is the whole point!
